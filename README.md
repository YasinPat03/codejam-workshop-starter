# CodeJam WebDev Workshop Starter

This repository provides you with a new React project. We're using it for the Web Dev workshop, but you're also welcome to use it as a starter kit for your actual CodeJam project!

## Software you need
Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and a code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended) installed.
